# Ukiyo
# Problem Statement 
A huge percentage of people nowadays suffer from diabetes, hypertension, arthritis, body aches, lung diseases, heart diseases, cancer, just to name a few, and the list goes on. Then there are life-long medications for every individual disease. More the health issues an individual has, the more the medicine intake. This directly affects an individual’s personal as well as professional life.
This problem concerns all of the society, each and every person, from a man with a common cold to the one affected with cancer or heart disease and could easily be solved (and even prevented from happening) with the help of breathing and full-body exercises on a daily routine. But do we have time for ourselves in this dynamic world where life is moving at its best pace?
Our aim is to protect, prevent, and cure people of existing as well as potential diseases in accordance with their time.
# Solution
Our web-app Ukiyo is an anytime go to buddy. It will serve as a good health trainer and well being caretaker.
